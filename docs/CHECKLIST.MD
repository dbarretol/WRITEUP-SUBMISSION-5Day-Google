# ✅ **Comprehensive Requirements Checklist for the Google AI Agents Capstone**

This checklist converts the long project description into a structured, easy-to-follow set of tasks covering:

* Track selection
* Pitch requirements
* Technical implementation
* Documentation
* Bonus points
* Submission requirements
* Team rules

Since you already built your **multi-agent system**, this checklist will help you confirm you meet all remaining requirements.

* [ ] Uses clean architecture
* [ ] No API keys or passwords included

---

# 📚 **4. Documentation (20 points)**

### Your submission must include:
